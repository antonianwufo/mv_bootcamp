# mv_bootcamp
My code written over the 5 week MV Bootcamp.

Notes to self:
- Keep the energy and enthusiasm from Day 1 throughout
- Don't run faster than you can walk
- Try not to apply your day job to the task concepts - it get's really confusing and might not apply!
- Do the basics of the assignment first, then build on it
- Practice makes perfect!
